## 1. Introduction: Who am I? 🤔

By day, I'm a mild-mannered researcher in Computer Science and Automation. By night, well, I’m usually debugging code. My superpower? Developing algorithms that make transport networks as green as Hulk after a traffic jam.

**Name:** [Tommaso Bosi]  
**Title:** Doctor in Computer Science and Automation (No, not a medical doctor)  
**Location:** Somewhere between a compiler error and a logical paradox

## 2. Research Interests: My Obsessions Explained 🕵️‍♂️

- **Optimization Algorithms**: Because who doesn't love a good puzzle?
- **Sustainable Transport Networks**: Saving the planet, one algorithm at a time.
- **Machine Learning & OR**: Teaching computers to think, or at least pretend to.

## 3. Projects: The Monsters I’ve Slain 🐉

### Project Green Scheduling
**Description:** Developed various metaheuristics to optimize scheduling for mixed-fleet of hybrid and electric buses. No more running out of battery halfway to your destination.  
**Outcome:** Reduced travel delays, fleet size, and carbon footprint, increased smugness.

### Shunting Operations at Intermodal Stations
**Description:** An event-based simulator framework to manage shunting operations at Bettembourg terminal Eurohub.  
**Outcome:** Improved efficiency, reduced delays, and more satisfied logistics managers.

### Train Calendar Generation
**Description:** A robust model for generating descriptive paragraphs of train calendars to optimize user/ICT interactions.  
**Outcome:** Better train information, less confusion, and a boost in public transport popularity.

## 4. Skills: Superpowers Unlocked 🦸‍♂️

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, C (and fluent in sarcasm)
- **Web Development:** HTML 5, CSS 3, Three.js
- **Tools & Technologies:** Pycharm/VS Code, Cplex, Scikit-learn, Chatgpt/Gemini/Copilot, Git (because what’s life without version control?)
- **Soft Skills:** Public Speaking, Team Leadership, Coffee Consumption
